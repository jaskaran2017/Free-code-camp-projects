                    <p>Django was invented to meet fast-moving newsroom deadlines, while satisfying the tough requirements of
                        experienced Web developers.</p>
                    <p>In this first Django article, we answer the question "What is Django?" and give you an overview of what
                        makes this web framework special. We'll outline the main features, including some of the advanced
                        functionality that we won't have time to cover in detail in this module. We'll also show you some of the
                        main building blocks of a Django application (although at this point you won't yet have a development
                        environment in which to test it).</p>

                    <p>With Django, you can take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care
                        of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to
                        reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.</p>

                        <li>An administrative interface that lets you add, change and delete polls.</li>

                    <p>Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website — from content management systems
                        and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any client-side framework, and
                        can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML, etc). The site you are
                        currently reading is built with Django!</p>

                    <p>Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL
                        injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication
                        system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.</p>

                        <li>It is a good idea to limit the accessibility of your caching system and database using a firewall.

                    </ul>
                    <p>XSS attacks allow a user to inject client side scripts into the browsers of other users. This is usually
                        achieved by storing the malicious scripts in the database where it will be retrieved and displayed to
                        other users, or by getting users to click a link which will cause the attacker’s JavaScript to be
                        executed by the user’s browser. However, XSS attacks can originate from any untrusted source of data,
                        such as cookies or Web services, whenever the data is not sufficiently sanitized before including in a
                        page.</p>

                        often has only a matter of hours to take a complicated Web application from concept to public launch.
